# Quizzer
### A binary application for quizzing
### Version 1.0.0


## About

Quizzer is a small side-project I wanted to make a while ago. I decided to make it now, in the golden age of Rust, and while it *certainly* isn't perfect, it's already most of what I set out to make.

## Goals

My goal, in the end, is to have a sort of general-purpose, open-source, no-server-needed Duolingo (in fact, it was originally going to be language-oriented). A few of the todo's I have:

 - Make more question types
 - Add scripting (especially for new question types)
 - Make a UI for selecting different packs
 - Add more dynamic packs
 - Make error handling better
 - Maybe a GUI at some point?

However, none of these are guarantees. **If you want to see Quizzer get better,** **_please_** **consider contributing to the project.**
